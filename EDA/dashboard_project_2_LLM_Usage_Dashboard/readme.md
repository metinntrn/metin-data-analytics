# 🤖 LLM Usage Dashboard

An interactive data analytics dashboard built with **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas** to explore and analyze Large Language Model (LLM) usage data.

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, performance metrics, filtering capabilities, and dataset exploration for understanding LLM behavior across different application domains.
